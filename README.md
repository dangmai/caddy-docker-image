Personal Caddy Docker image
===========================

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/dangmai/caddy-docker-image.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/dangmai/caddy-docker-image)

This is my personal Caddy Docker image builder,
which is based off of [abisoft's image](https://github.com/abiosoft/caddy-docker).

It bundles the Cloudflare DNS plugin by default
